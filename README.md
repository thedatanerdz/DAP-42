Problem statements
Determining the success of a global Covid vaccine program. 

Data Description
The dataset was taken from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations. The dataset includes the important values we will be using to determine the success of the vaccine program including 

People fully vaccinated (2 doses of the vaccine)
People partially vaccinated (1 dose of the vaccine)
People not vaccinated (no doses of the vaccine)

Each of these columns were broken up into different geographical locations because the performance of the vaccine is dependent on factors related to geographical location. There are several factors that could contribute to a vaccine performing differently in different countries. Some of the key reasons are:

Variants: If the virus has mutated in a particular country and a new variant has emerged, the vaccine may not be as effective against that variant. This can lead to differences in the vaccine's effectiveness between countries.

Population differences: Different countries may have different populations with varying levels of health, genetics, and susceptibility to the virus. These differences could impact the vaccine's effectiveness in different countries.

Vaccine distribution and administration: The way a vaccine is distributed and administered can also impact its effectiveness. If a vaccine is not distributed widely or administered correctly, it may not be as effective in certain countries.

Health infrastructure: The availability and quality of healthcare infrastructure can also play a role in vaccine effectiveness. Countries with weaker healthcare systems may struggle to distribute and administer vaccines effectively, which could impact their effectiveness.

Behavioral factors: Cultural and social factors can also impact vaccine effectiveness. For example, vaccine hesitancy may be higher in certain countries, which could impact the overall effectiveness of the vaccine.



Methods
The three groups studied to determine the success of the global Covid vaccine program was
People fully vaccinated (2 doses of the vaccine)
People partially vaccinated (1 dose of the vaccine)
People not vaccinated (no doses of the vaccine)

The effectiveness of the vaccine was judged based on if the people who were fully and partially vaccinated had a significantly lower chance of contracting the Covid virus. A bar graph was created with a synchronized dual axis of the countries vs the share of people fully or partially vaccinated over the population. 

Results
Vaccines are effective in combating Covi virus
The higher the GDP, the more likely the citizens are vaccinated 

Conclusion
Best plan of action for citizens 
Become fully vaccinated 

Best plan of action for governments, health care sector and health care professionals
Enable citizens to have access to vaccines 
Invest money into vaccine research and development
